# Abode Property Search

## Description

A property search application built using React and Tailwind. In order to decrease loading times and improve overall responsiveness and speed, this is a single page application that utilises React Router to dynamically render content instead of redirecting to a new URL and loading the entire page.

## Installation

- Simply click on the URL to be navigated to the web page in your browser.

## Usage

- At the top of the home page there is an input box, type the town / city in which you would like to search for a property. Select "sale" or "rent" and then press "Enter" on your keyboard. If no selection is made, rent is the default parameter.
- You will be taken to a search results page that shows the current listings. You can filter the results further using the drop-down filters at the top of the page.
- To keep track of your favourite listings click on the heart icon at the bottom of the property card. This will be saved to your favourites, which can be navigated to via the navigation bar.
- To express your interest in a property click on the "Contact Us" button at the bottom of the property card and you will be taken to the contact page.
