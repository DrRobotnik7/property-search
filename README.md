# Abode Property Search

## Description

A property search application built using React and Tailwind. In order to decrease loading times and improve overall responsiveness and speed, this is a single page application that utilises React Router to dynamically render content instead of redirecting to a new URL and loading the entire page.

## Credits

I would like to acknowledge my peers in Team Abode, we haven't all worked together as a team during this bootcamp and it has been a pleasure to work.

I would also like to acknowledge the developers that created React, Tailwind and the Zoopla API used on this project.

Finally I used https://getform.io/ to generate my form endpoint so I can store and view messages submitted by users on my Contact page.
